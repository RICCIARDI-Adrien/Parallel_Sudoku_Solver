# Parallel Sudoku Solver

## Description

A really simple solver using a backtrack algorithm to recursively solve the grid.  
Complex grids solving is faster than my previous [sequential sudoku solver](https://github.com/RICCIARDI-Adrien/Sudoku_Solver) because several grids can be searched in the same time on multicore processors.

## Building

Type `make` to build the program.

## Testing

Go to `Tests` directory and type `./Tests.bash`.
